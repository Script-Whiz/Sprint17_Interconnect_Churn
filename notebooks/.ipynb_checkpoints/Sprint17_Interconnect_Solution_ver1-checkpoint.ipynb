    "I encountered 3 main difficulties while working on this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I looked for missing files, while cleaning the four datasets, but I failed to look for NaN, until days in to the project. My models kept failing because of the NaN. But the error that I was receiving was vague, and it took me days to figure out what the problem was. It turned out that there were 11 rows that had NaN in the 'TotalCharges' column. These NaN only existed in one of the four datasets; the contract dataset. To solve, I looked for min and max BeginDate, in the contract dataset, and found that max BeginDate was the same BeginDate as all 11 of those NaN rows. I came to the conclusion that these 11 customers had not received their first bill yet, and that is why there was no number in TotalCharges column, for these 11 customers. Since they had not paid their first bill yet, TotalCharges must be zero. I used fillna to change all 11 Nan to 0. After doing so, my models worked fine.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The SVC model would not work inside my model creation function. Once I pulled the SVC model out of the function, and just ran SVC, on it's own, outside of the function, the SVC model worked. I do think that I changed the code though after pulling it out of the model creation function. I found out, after the fact, that SVC didn't really need to be included in this project, as it was not covered in the TT Data Science course. So, I probably could have saved a few days of time by not attempting to add the SVC model in to this project. It did not produce the highest AUC ROC score of my models anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The EndDate(which was the target for this project) had both dates, and strings (\"No\") as values. I was not sure what to do with this. But, a tutor told me that models work best with numbers. So, I converted this datatype to int, and made \"no\" equal to 0, and everything else equal to 1. Then, I decided to make most of the other columns to be 0's and 1's, as opposed to True / False, as the numbers would work best with the models."

    "The main purpose of this project was to find out which customers are likely to churn soon. I created a variety of models, with a variety of hyperparameter tunings,  including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and SVC. The model that proved to be the most successful was **Gradient Boosting**, with an AUC ROC score of <span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>86.1 \\% for the validation dataset.</strong></span> The next best model score, for validation dataset, was **Random Forest**, with an AUC ROC score of **85.7%**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of the model testing displayed varied performance levels among the algorithms evaluated, with specific details as follows:\n",
    "1. **Logistic Regression** emerged with a **Test Accuracy** of **0.7985** and a **Test AUC-ROC** of **0.8489**. This model shows a balanced performance and could be suitable for applications requiring interpretability.\n",
    "2. **Random Forest** achieved a **Test Accuracy** of **0.7994** and an impressive **Test AUC-ROC** of **0.8494**, indicating its robust ability in classification tasks, particularly in handling non-linear data structures.\n",
    "3. **Decision Tree** performed slightly lower, with a **Test Accuracy** of **0.7796** and a **Test AUC-ROC** of **0.8279**. While easy to interpret, the decision tree model may not generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "4. **Gradient Boosting** displayed solid results with a **Test Accuracy** of **0.7938** and **Test AUC-ROC** of **0.8493**, showing that it is a strong contender among the ensemble methods, suggesting its capacity to handle different types of data distributions effectively.\n",
    "5. The **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** achieved a **Test Accuracy** of **0.7909** and a **Test AUC-ROC** of **0.8417** after parameter tuning, indicating that it performs well although slightly below Random Forest.\n",

    "### How do different account types (1-year, 2-year, month-to-month) influence churn rates?\n",
    "- **Answer**: <span style=\"color:green;\"><strong>Yes, the type of plan does effect churn rate.</strong></span>\n",
    "- Customers on month-to-month plans have a **42.7%** churn rate, almost four times higher than those on the one-year plan, and **15 times** more than those on the two-year plan.\n",
    "### Do customers who pay for extra services churn at different rates?\n",
    "- **Internet Service**\n",
